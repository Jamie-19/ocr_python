THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE OF ART
Literature must rest always on a principle, and temporal
considerations are no principle at all. For to the poet all
times and places are one; the stuff he deals with is eternal
and eternally the same: no theme is inept, no past or pres-
ent preferable. The steam whistle will not affright him nor
the flutes of Arcadia weary him; for him there is but one
time, the artistic moment; but one law, the law of form;
but one jand, the land of Beauty—a land removed indeed
from the real world and yet more sensuous because more
enduring; calm, yet with that calm which dwells in the
faces of the Greek statues, the calm which comes not from
the rejection but from the absorption of passion, the calm
which despair and sorrow cannot disturb but intensify only.
And so it comes that he who seems to stand most remote
from his age is he who mirrors it best, because he has
stripped life of what is accidental and transitory, stripped
it of that “mist of familiarity which makes life obscure to us”.
